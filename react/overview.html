<h1>React</h1>
<p>react  is a view library created by Fb in order to be able to have multiple developers working on the same time at the website</p>
<h3>Think of React like at a bread machine - trow the ingredients and the machine is taking care of the end result</h3>
<ul>
  <li>React is made up of components (lego blocks to be combined)- atoms -> molecules -> organisms -> templates -> pages</li>
<br>
<img src="images/react_components.jpg" alt="">
<li>Each component is independent and it has its own functionality - it reduces dependencies -can be used anywhere in the app </li>
<li>One way data flow - if a component is changing only its children know about it and change accordingly, not the parents </li>
<li><p>Virtual DOM - as a dev we know that we need to reduce the DOM manipulation as the JS Engine (V8in chrome) slows the performance and is difficult to organize it - creates bugs</p>
<p>React Bot will take care of the DOM manipulation as it will create a Virtual DOM and it will paint the canvas in the most efficient way </p></li>

<li> <p>in order to update a package - you just need to go in the package.json file (where all the packages and their versions are) and manually update it to the latest version</p>
<p>2- run npm install - and all the packages will be installed </p>
<p>npx - npm package installer - <a href="https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b"></a> </p>
<h3>make sure the update doesn't break the app - in large projects there is a person that takes care of this updates </h3> </li>
<li>React allows us to use different css files for each component</li>
<li>React has webpack underneath the hood and does the bundling for us - which means we can use "import"(./ - used if the files are in the same directory) to use other files</li>
<li>a component has to always render something</li>
<li>when building a component the name will always be capital - as the classes name
  <p>inside the component class - always - render(){return (....)}</p>
  <p>the component needs to be exported (using "default - only if exports 1 thing") from the definition fileand imported in the index file </p>
</li>
<li>JSX - it allows you to write the html syntax inside the js files - is what react uses to create the components - Any line that start with the "<" character starts a JSX block.</li>
<li>tachyons - like bootstrap for react - by using the classNames provided it allows to add style easier to jsx</li>
<li>in the index you can define properties for the component <p><Hello greeting = {"Hello " + "React Ninja"}/></p>to be used in the component file definition <p>{this.props.greeting}</p></li>
</ul>
